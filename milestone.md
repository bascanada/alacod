## Basic gameplay of a CoD zombie like

COA

1. Spawn in the map in multiplayer 1 to 4 players
2. Players start with one weapon
3. Players have money to do purchase, they get money by killing zombie and repairing windows
3. Character can purchase weapon on the map with 2 slot
4. Zombie are spawning outside the level and need to enter with windows (breaking them)
5. The window can be repaired (3 health)
6. Door can be purchased to unlock the next zone. (All entity in the zone become active, zombie spawner)

7. The gameplay is based on round , each round player must set an increasing amount of zombies. When
a wave is over they have a little break before the next one.

8. Zombie try to go to the closest windows to destroy it and enter inside the kill the nearest players.



This is a base summary of the gameplay that i want to achieve first in my engine.

What i'm currently missing:

1. Game mode system that control player inventory, round, money, ....
2. Zombie have basic AI but don't know how to cross building and windows and don't attack
3. Window are created but no logic with them neither sprite for animation and repair
4. System to only load or activated the entity in the level that are open to the players
