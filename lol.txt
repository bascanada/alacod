# What to do for my game


I need to go back where i was stuck in the previous implementation before bringing back the game logic and try to properly reimplement with rollback

## Glossary

* BasedMap  : LDtk map
* Room : each level in LDtk can be a room if it's put in the final GameMap
* GameMap : is the generated Map from the BasedMap based on it's level

* Door : a door that need to be purchase to separate level

## Map generation

Each BaseMap is created with LDtk. Composed of multiple level.

BaseMap + seed + mode (optional) + parameters = GameMap

Basically giving the BaseMap and a seed the GameMap will always be the same.
So all game client will have the BaseMap and shared a seed for a game to have
the same GameMap. And the mode we be to have different algorythm for different
kind of result in the generation. And the parameters dictate the max size and
other stuff like that.

### BaseMap contains

Contain a set of Level with the same dimension.
Each Level must follow the Room composition.

### Room composition

Each Room piece must belong to a category.

        * Spawning room
        * room (normal room)

Each room have it exist marked, each exist is a door. (Need to be purchase)

Each room can have a set a point for item and crate.

Each room has a set of zombie spawn points.

#### Room Entity

* Door (2 tile wide)
* Windows (1 tile wide)
* SpawnPoint
   * ZoombieSpawnPoint (1 tile wide)
   * WeaponSpawnPoint (1 tile wide)
   * CrateSpawnPoint (2 tile wide)
   * MachineSpawnPoint (1 tile wide)
* Trap

### GameMap generation

The game map generation will have multiple implementation ( the mode ) but let
start with the basic one.

Parameters for now will be.

* maxRoomCount: maximum number of room in the map
* maxX
* maxY

Basically the GameMap will used all existing level and used them to create the map.


* One spawning room will be selected as a starting point.
* The range will be defined with the maxX and maxY to determine the size of the coord with 0.0 as the center
* The room will be place randomly on the map coordinate in the range
* Starting from this room will start randomly placing room on unconncted door
* When all door are connected or no level can be placed inside the max the map is finish generated the shape
* After that all Weapon , Crate and Machine spawn point will be populated with item with the value of the item
        progression the further we are from the starting room.
* Now it's done and player could start playing in it.
